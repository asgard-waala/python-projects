# This code is a simple implementation of an "email slicer" that extracts the username, domain, and extension from an email address.
---

The `main()` function is defined, which prints a welcome message and prompts the user to enter their email address. The email address is then split using the `split()` method and assigned to the `username`, `domain`, and `extension` variables.

Finally, the function prints out the extracted username, domain, and extension.

The `while True` loop ensures that the `main()` function runs continuously, allowing the user to input multiple email addresses.

In summary, this code allows the user to extract the username, domain, and extension from an email address, and can be used to analyze multiple email addresses by running the `main()` function repeatedly.
