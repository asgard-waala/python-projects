# This is a Python code for a monthly payment loan calculator that takes in the loan amount, interest rate, and number of years as input and calculates the monthly payment using the formula for an annuity payment. 

## Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The code defines a function called `main()` which prints a message to the user that this is a monthly payment loan calculator.

2. The user is prompted to enter the loan amount, rate of interest, and number of years using the `input()` function. The `input()` function takes in the user's input as a string and the `float()` function converts it to a floating-point number.

3. The monthly interest rate is calculated by dividing the `annual interest rate (APR)` by 1200. This is because the interest rate is given as an annual percentage rate (APR) and needs to be converted to a monthly rate. The 1200 comes from the fact that there are 12 months in a year and the interest rate needs to be divided by 100 to convert it from a percentage to a decimal.

4. The number of months is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12, since there are 12 months in a year.

5. The monthly payment is calculated using the formula for an annuity payment, which is:

    `PMT = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))`

    where:
    - PMT is the monthly payment
    - P is the loan amount
    - r is the monthly interest rate
    - n is the number of months

    The formula calculates the amount of money needed to pay off the loan in equal monthly payments over the specified period of time.

6. The code uses the print() function to display the monthly payment to the user, formatted to two decimal places using the `%.2f` format specifier.

7. Finally, the `main()` function is called to execute the code.
