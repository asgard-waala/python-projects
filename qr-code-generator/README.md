# This is a Python code for generating a QR code using the `qrcode` library.

1. The `datetime` module is used to get the current date and time, which is then used to name the output image file.

2. The `generate_qrcode` function takes a text input, creates a QR code with the input text, and saves the output image file with the current date and time as the name.

3. The user is prompted to enter the text they want to generate a QR code for using the `input()` function.

4. Overall, this code should work as intended for generating a QR code for a given text input and saving it as a PNG image with a timestamped filename.
