# This code defines a function called `replace_word()` which replaces a specified word in a given sentence with another word provided by the user.
---
The function first initializes a string variable `sentence` with a sample sentence "Hi there! My name is Deepak." The function then prompts the user to enter a word to replace and another word to use as its replacement. These inputs are stored in the variables `word_to_replace` and `word_replacement`, respectively.

The function then uses the `replace()` method of the string class to replace all occurrences of the `word_to_replace` with the `word_replacement` in the sentence. The resulting string is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.

Finally, the `replace_word()` function is called at the end of the code to execute its functionality.
