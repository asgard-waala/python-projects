# This is a Python program that checks the connectivity of a website.

1. The first line imports the `urllib.request` module and aliases it as `url_request`.

2. The `main` function takes a single argument, `url`, which is the URL of the website to check.

3. Inside the `main` function, the program prints a message indicating that it is checking connectivity. It then uses the `urllib.request.urlopen` function to try to connect to the website. If the connection is successful, the program prints a message indicating that it connected successfully, along with the HTTP status code of the response.

4. Finally, the program prompts the user to enter the URL of the website to check, and calls the `main` function with that URL as an argument.
