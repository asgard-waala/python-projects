# This code is a simple implementation of a calculator program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
---
The code defines four functions, `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`, each of which takes two arguments and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. The result is then printed to the console.

The `while True` loop runs continuously until the user chooses to exit the program by selecting the "E" option. Within the loop, the program prints out a menu of options, prompting the user to select an operation. Based on the user's input, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers, and then calls the corresponding arithmetic function with those numbers.

If the user selects the "E" option, the program prints a message and quits. If the user enters an invalid option, the program prints an error message and prompts the user to choose a valid option.

In summary, this code allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations using a simple calculator program, and can be used repeatedly until the user chooses to exit the program.
