# This is a Python program that simulates rolling two dice and displays their values and corresponding graphical representation using ASCII art. The program uses a dictionary to store the ASCII art for each possible roll of the dice.

1. The program first defines the `roll_dice()` function which takes no arguments. It then defines a dictionary `dice_drawing` which contains the ASCII art for each possible roll of a standard six-sided die.

2. The function prompts the user to input whether they want to roll the dice or not using the `input()` function. The `while` loop will continue to execute as long as the user inputs "yes". Inside the loop, the function generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 inclusive using the `random.randint()` function, one for each dice roll. It then displays the values of the two rolls and their corresponding ASCII art using the `print()` function and the `join()` method to concatenate the lines of the ASCII art into a single string.

3. After displaying the results, the function prompts the user again whether they want to roll the dice again or not. If the user inputs "no", the `while` loop will exit and the function will return control to the calling code.

4. To use the program, one simply needs to call the `roll_dice()` function. The program will prompt the user to roll the dice and display the results until the user chooses to stop.
